# Why We Need to Create a Token in Backend

## 1. What is a Token?
A **token** is a unique, encrypted string generated by the backend, typically after a user logs in or authenticates.  
It is used to **identify and authorize a user** in subsequent requests without requiring credentials (username/password) every time.

---

## 2. Why Do We Need to Create a Token?
Tokens are essential in modern web applications for secure and efficient authentication.

### ✅ 1. Stateless Authentication
- Without tokens, the backend would need to store **sessions** for each user.
- Tokens (like JWT) make the server **stateless**, as it only verifies tokens without storing session data.

---

### ✅ 2. Enhanced Security
- Users don’t need to send passwords on every request.
- Tokens are securely signed and can only be verified by the backend using a **secret key**.

---

### ✅ 3. Prevent Unauthorized Access
- Only users with a valid token can access **protected routes**.
- Tokens are verified on every request.

---

### ✅ 4. Perfect for API-based App
- Tokens are ideal for **SPA (Single Page Applications)** and **mobile apps** where frontend and backend are separate.

---

### ✅ 5. Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Tokens can contain **user roles** (e.g., admin, user).
- The backend can authorize users based on roles embedded in the token.

---

### ✅ 6. Expiration & Refresh
- Tokens **expire** after a fixed duration to reduce risk if stolen.
- Refresh tokens allow secure re-issuance of access tokens.

---

## 3. Token Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with email/password.
2. Backend verifies credentials and generates a **token**.
3. Token is sent to the client (stored in **cookies** or **localStorage**).
4. Client sends token in every API request (Authorization Header).
5. Backend verifies token → grants or denies access.

---

## 4. Example Token Payload (JWT)
```json
{
  "id": "12345",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1727659800
}
